/*

To visualize the performance, we
use VisualAccumulator (see page 95) to plot two points corresponding to each put()
operation as follows: for the i th put() operation we plot a gray point with x coordinate
i and y coordinate the number of key compares it uses and a red point with x coordinate
i and y coordinate the cumulative average number of key compares used for the
first i put() operations.
